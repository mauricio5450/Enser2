Welcome to Enser. This program is built as a service learning oppurtunity for STEM students that allows for teachers and stakeholders to have unique tools in order keep students engaged.There are 3 different pages types there are student, teacher, and stakeholder pages. They each have their own login and sign up pages. They differ in the type of things that you can do in each. 

Lets take a road down the teacher pages. The initial page we see in the dashboard which will include different classses we decide to make. When taking a look at the screen we can see a prominant create class button. When pressing this button we are then taken to a page where we can type in values for said class. When enterning everything we then hit the submit button and are presented with a popup that says that our information has been uploaded succesfully. We can then traverse to the original dashboard page and see that our newly created class is now found there. We can then traverse to the different tabs such as stakeholders and projects which can help us figure out what different stakeholders are found in the program along with different projects. If we return to the dashboard we can then see that if we click on see class we are presented with a dash. Then more tabs appear. These allow for adding things to the class such as syllabus's and assignments. These each function similarly as the class creation where we fill in the blanks with these pieces of information. 

When taking a look at the student page. We get a similair dashboard which will shows us the classes this student is enrolled in. If we go to the courses tab we can view all the available classes that this student can enroll in and take. Then the student can view the different instructors and stakeholders.They can also message any person if they wish using the messaging system. In order to use it well on one device it is good to open one tab in incognito and another in regular chrome. Then you can message between the system. 

When looking at the stakeholders web pages we see that we can do the same thing as a professor by making a project. It takes the same process as making a class with the same form style. They can view the different students and instructors found on the site. They can also have the advantage of having a message system that is the biggest commonality between all three different pages.
